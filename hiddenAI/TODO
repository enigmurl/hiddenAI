PRIORITIES
	1)Different nets:
		CNNS,make matrix multiplication?,need to optimize,
		GANs,make the training use the optimizers of the layers rather than how it is right now, may need to rework optimizers for this, or add a convertor, ConditonalGAN,Stack GAN
		RNNS need to implement
	2)q Learnings
	3)CrossEntropy,other losses, other types of training(the one on computerfile for face recognition), and fix the training for non neural networks
	4)linear regression, decision tree 

FEATURES
	1)KWARGS: starting_value,padding or not
	2) add more losses and regulizers

TESTING
	1)Test all layers

RESEARCH
	1) deconvolutional
	2) unpooling
BUGS
	1)FIX POOLING PADDING
	1) Softmax, Cross Entropy
	2) regularization

OPTIMIZATION
	1)Convolutions, Max/Avg Pooling
