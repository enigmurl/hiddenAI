have a network match something with a state and action

ACTION PLANNING NETWORK:
	first nn:
	input is the current state
	outputs an N number of neuron, N must be a square number
	Then, it makes the output into a matrix with dimensions root N and root N, that is called M0
	Then, based on the Parameter P, it factors it into P sub matrices that are exponents of M0, for example p =3, then it would be M0^1/6,M0^1/3,M0^1/2,find the pattern
	second nn:
	input is the first of the output matrices, so for p = 3, M0^1/6
	it outputs a one hot vector of what to do,(may not be a one hot vector though)
