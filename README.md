* This is an archive of a repository I made when I was in 9th grade. It contains a self written ML "library," capable of gradient descent on basic sequential neural networks (e.g. CNNs, Fully Connected Layers). 
* It is not actively maintained and contains a plethora of bad conventions. Therefore, it is not recommended to actually use the code. The only reason it is available publicly is to serve as memory of one of my earliest ML projects.
* I ultimately ended work here after being unable to get GANs (generative adversarial networks) to work properly. However, digit and character recognition were able to work to a somewhat reasonable level (95% for digit, ~60% for character based on my memories).
