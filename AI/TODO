PRIORITIES
	1)MAKE DIRECTORIES WORKING PROPERLY, SO TEST/EXAMPLES FOLDER WORKS AND MAKE AI AN ACTUAL MODULE 
	2)Different nets:
		CNNS,need to optimize, add the different types of convolutional layers,(deconvolutional)
		GANs,make the training use the optimizers of the layers rather than how it is right now, may need to rework optimizers for this, or add a convertor
		RNNS need to implement
	3)q Learnings
	4)CrossEntropy,other losses, other types of training(the one on computerfile for face recognition), and fix the training for non neural networks
	5)linear regression, decision tree 
	6)finish up pooling(the numpythonic way)

FEATURES
	1)KWARGS: starting_value,padding or not
	2) Make descents optimizers, also add more losses and regulizers
	3)learning rate a class

TESTING
	1)Test all layers

RESEARCH
	1)What is Dropout,Momentum,Decay,(Fix regularization)?
	2)Values of a cnn kernel(-1 to 1 only?), is momentum only for SGD
	3)Is the name filter_size or kernel_size 
	4)Are iterations num batches or num total or what
BUGS
	1 )Softmax 
	2) regularization

OPTIMIZATION
	1)Convolutions, Max/Avg Pooling
